# (Un)Muter

(Un)Muter is a very basic Opera browser extension which allows user to mute his current tab quickly by just pressing the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+M). 

I'm using this as I haven't been able to find the option for it in the browser itself and using mouse is sometimes just too tedious

## Installation

Download the [crx file](https://github.com/clearedTakeoff/opera-un-muter/releases), open Opera and type `opera://extensions` in your address bar. Once the extension page is opened simply drag and drop the downloaded file to the list of extensions.

## Usage

Use the keystroke *Ctrl + M* on to mute/unmute currently opened tab.
